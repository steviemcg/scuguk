    intro: Auditing what the customer sees in JSS + GraphQL
    description: >
      An industry sometimes has strict regulations on having to prove how a (potential) customer interacts with the brand and what data they were shown in response. The headless nature of JSS + GraphQL gives a good opportunity to capture this raw data without the extra markup and styling. Steve will discuss his solution of storing this sensitive information and presenting it in a fast React UI.
