    intro: Best practices using SXA
    description: One of the greatest things of the Sitecore Experience Accelerator (SXA) is it is flexibility; however, it is also one of the pitfalls. In this session Mark van Aalst will explain what he sees as best practices when developing an SXA website. You will learn how SXA has been developed and what the reasons and stories are behind specific features. Learn about features you use every day like the promo component, the best ways of implementing third party libraries and how to make sure your can easily upgrade to newer versions. Everything that you will see can be used right away in your existing projects.
