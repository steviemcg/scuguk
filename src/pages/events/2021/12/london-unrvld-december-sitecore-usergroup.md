    intro: Becoming a Sitecore MVP
    description: It is a truth universally acknowledged that the Sitecore MVP process has tripped up a lot of very good and highly qualified people. There are often a lot of questions about what types of content count, how everyday work-based activities integrate with community contributions, which social media activities count (and which ones don’t), and what the difference REALLY is between the Ambassador and Strategy categories. In this session we’ll dive into recommendations and tips to provide a bit of clarity and give folks a resource to refer to while gearing up in the 10 months that come before application season.
