    title: 'What’s this Kubernetes business then?'
    description: "There's a lot of talk about using Docker for Sitecore development (some of it Jeremy's previous user-group talks!), but what does it mean to take a container-based solution to production? What do you need to think about, and how is it different to a PaaS or IaaS deployment? This talk will give you a beginner's introduction to this topic, and help you understand what you need to think about for your projects."
