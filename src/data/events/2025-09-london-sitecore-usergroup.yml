    title: Building content for the age of AI-powered searches
    description: AI-powered discovery tools like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google’s AI Overviews are rewriting the rules of search. Visibility is no longer just about keyword density, it’s about being understood and reused by large language models and AI bots.
